Welcome to final report of the Group Swatch 

In this report, you can find the following sections:
#### 1.) Team Approach and Task Division
#### 2.) Comparison of Different Models
#### 3.) Final Model
#### 4.) Application of the Model
#### 5.) Final Words


#### 1.) Team Approach and Task Division

We approached the task as a reiterative process, incrementally improving our model to predict the language level of French texts. We started off with simple ML models inlcuding Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest before then advancing to more sophisticated text embeddings. Within the different models, we used hyper-parameter optimization to find the best solution. 
From the beginning, we thereby already started to think about potential applications of our final model, an attractive user interfence, and an engaging concept for the video presentation. 
Hence, we distirbuted the tasks among the members accordingly:
- Giulia: creating the ML model to predict the language level of French texts
- Rebecca: working on the application and UI of the final model as well as preparing the report


#### 2.) Comparison of Different Models


| Metric    | Logistic Regression | KNN | Decision Tree | Random Forest | Any other technique |
|-----------|---------------------|-----|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Precision |                     |     |               |               |                     |
| Recall    |                     |     |               |               |                     |
| F1-score  |                     |     |               |               |                     |
| Accuracy  |                     |     |               |               |                     |
